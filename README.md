# Demo App – CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker & AWS EC2

This project demonstrates a complete **DevOps CI/CD Pipeline** using modern DevOps tools and automation practices.

The pipeline automates:

* Build
* Testing
* Code Quality Analysis
* Docker Image Creation
* Deployment on AWS EC2

# Jenkins Pipeline Stages

The Jenkins pipeline performs the following stages:

1. Checkout Code
2. Build Application
3. SonarQube Analysis
4. Docker Build
5. Docker Push
6. Deploy Container

---

# Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure the following are installed:

* Java 17
* Maven
* Docker
* Jenkins
* SonarQube
* Git

---

# Build the Application

Run the following Maven command:

```bash id="91c8f0"
mvn clean package
```

Generated JAR file:

```text id="zz5a0v"
target/demo-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

---

# Run Application Locally

```bash id="p7ayll"
java -jar target/demo-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Application URL:

```text id="u4myci"
http://localhost:8081
```

---

# Docker Commands

## Build Docker Image

```bash id="zq6gmg"
docker build -t ckshetty4/demo-app:latest .
```

## Run Docker Container

```bash id="4n03vi"
docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name poc8-container ckshetty4/poc8-demo:latest
```

---

# DockerHub Repository

Docker Image:

```text id="nh18p7"
ckshetty4/poc8-demo:latest
```

---

# SonarQube Analysis

Run SonarQube analysis using:

```bash id="6l8c68"
mvn sonar:sonar -Dsonar.projectKey=poc8-demo
```


---

# AWS EC2 Deployment

Services hosted on EC2:

| Service         | Port |
| --------------- | ---- |
| Jenkins         | 8080 |
| SonarQube       | 9000 |
| Spring Boot App | 8081 |

---

# GitHub Webhook Integration

GitHub webhook automatically triggers Jenkins pipeline whenever code is pushed.

Webhook URL:

```text id="8o9k92"
http://<EC2-IP>:8080/github-webhook/
```

---

# Application Output

Final deployed application output:

```text id="4gwzjf"
DevOps CI/CD Pipeline is Working!
```
